This project is designed to teach the basics of Go programming and explore the environment used in web service development.
The entire project was created thanks to a [video course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbTTxxr-hMmyFAvyn7DeOgNRN8BQdjFm8).

During the course, I was able to break down the following concepts
- Developing Web Applications in Go, following the REST API design
- Using the framework [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- Using the library [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) to work with the database
- Starting postgres database with a docker. Migration file generation
- Configuring an application using the [viper library](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
